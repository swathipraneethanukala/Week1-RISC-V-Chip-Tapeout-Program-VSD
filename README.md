# Week1-RISC-V-Chip-Tapeout-Program-VSD
Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)**!  

This repository captures my **step-by-step learning and progress** of week1 as I work through  tasks and milestones.  

---
## 📌 About the Program
This program offers hands-on experience in designing a **System-on-Chip (SoC)**, starting from **RTL design** and taking it all the way to **GDSII** using open-source EDA tools.  
It is part of one of the **largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiatives in India**, bringing together thousands of participants to strengthen the country’s **semiconductor ecosystem** and nurture a new generation of chip designers.
